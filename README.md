# Feast

Mod Link: https://modrinth.com/mod/feast1

Current food mods are too "vanilla unfriendly". This mod is made with that in mind—a food mod to complement the vanilla experience. Blocks and items shouldnt take you through GUIs and menus—everything that can, should happen directly in the overworld. No clunky menus.

Feast is a food mod slowly being built from the ground up. It currently adds:

## Cutting Board
- Right click with an item in your hand to place items on the board.
- Right click with an empty hand to clear the board.
- Shift-Right click the board to craft your recipe!
- Crafted by lining the bottom of a crafting table with 3 wooden slabs.
- (REI support & custom recipes through datapacks coming soon)

## Rice
- Right click with rice on a dirt block in a 1 block deep body of water to plant.
- When grown, right click the crop to harvest it just like vanilla's sweet berries.

## The Faraway Traveler
- Place a Decorated Pot near an unemployed villager for him to become a Faraway Traveler.
- Trades Rice for emeralds (currently his only trade). His prices will get cheaper the more you trade.

## Stove and Stove Pot
- Both currently uncraftable.
- Right click a body of water with a stove pot to fill it with water.
- Right click a stove with a stove pot to put it on the stove.
- KNOWN BUG: filled stove pots do not appear filled when placed on stove. Dont worry! They are.

## Spice Rack
- Hold up to 6 items in its inventory.
- Can see the contents directly on the shelf in the overworld.
- KNOWN BUG: In multiplayer, when removing an item, the removed item still renders in the overworld for other players until other players right click the spice rack.
- Crafted by surrounding an oak slab with oak logs in a crafting table.
